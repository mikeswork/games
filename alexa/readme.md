Name the Movie
--------------

An Alexa movie-guessing game for kids. I architected, programmed, and tested it.

All the code is included, but not the data side since Exponential Entertainment does not want me to share it.

This is primarily a voice-only game, but I did create a basic UI that displays the question, answer, and score. These files are in /apl/
