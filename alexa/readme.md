Name the Movie
--------------

An Alexa movie guessing game for kids. I architected, programmed, and tested it. This was a challenging app that stretched the capabilities of Alexa by mixing speech strings with recorded voice-over mp3's and utilizing an experimental purchasing API that Amazon had not officially released at the time of development.

All code is included except for the trivia data.

This is primarily a voice-only game, but I did create a basic UI that displays the question, answer, and user score. These UI templates are in the /apl/ folder.
