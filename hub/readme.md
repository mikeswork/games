Hub
---

This was an ambitious project to create a customizable area for users to come back to and for the administrators to keep alive by changing skins (e.g. for different holidays, sporting events, etc.), adding rewards, featuring contests, and linking to different games. The user would have a default account which would keep track of their points. They get points by visiting certain areas, completing games, or getting minimum scores in the different games. If they registered their account, they could keep track of these points, and receive rewards as their skill lever increased. Rewards would allow them to customize their hub area with different items (some moving via animated gifs or a sprite player). Because we had to support some limited hardware, none of the existing sprite player solutions worked for us, so I built a sprite player that allowed us to play animations and customize them (loop/play once, speed, delay, delay between play-throughs, etc.) I also contributed a lot to adding additional rooms to the experience and discovering the best technique for visual transitions between the spaces (e.g. css animation vs. video).
