This was an ambitious project with many moving parts, which I built with one other dev (we both worked on all the components and areas). By developing an easily customizable site, we succeeded at creating an experience that users would want to play in and return to. An administrator is able to keep things fresh by changing skins (e.g. for different holidays, sporting events, etc.), adding rewards, featuring contests, and spotlighting different games. To further improve retention, each user automatically gets a default account that keeps track of their points. They earn points by visiting certain areas, completing games, or achieving minimum scores. After they decide to register their account, they receive different rewards as their skill lever increases. Rewards allow users to customize their home screen with various fun items (some animated via gifs or a sprite player). 

Since we had to support limited hardware, none of the existing Node or JavaScript sprite player solutions worked for us. So I built a lightweight, reusable player that allowed us to do custom animations (with settings such as loop/play once, speed, delay, delay between play-throughs, etc.) 

In preparation for a major release, I investigated the best approach for adding more rooms/sections to the experience and discovered the most intuitive technique for a visual transition between the spaces (i.e. css/js animation vs. video).
