I skinned this entire arcade using the Advent component that I created (see "Hallmark" in this repo). The flexibility of this module allowed us to apply a completely different style to the arcade without needing to enhance or refactor the original component.

Visually, this arcade pushed the boundaries of what we had done before. It needed to run on limited hardware so I employed a combination of compressed images, video, and even animated gifs.
