I built the complex layout and visuals of this site using the Advent component that I created on another project (see "Hallmark" in this repo). The flexibility of the module allows us to apply a completely different style each time that we use it without needing to enhance or refactor the original component.

Visually, this site pushed the boundaries of what we had done before. It needed to run on limited hardware, so I employed a combination of compressed images, video, and even animated gifs.
